## About CliBot
CliBot is a command line tools that can automate a simple task like create folder with multiple file or create a scrapping through command line. The actual reason why i create this because :
1. i can move freely in cmd, for example if i was inside desktop i can't straightly go to document without go back to deafult path(C:\Users\My-pc) 
2. I don't know how to create a folder with files inside using cmd
3. I don't know how to create file with cmd
4. I thnik it's really cool if i could google search
5. Of course with api in it

and yes, I create projects for my own needs, but of course you can also use it, and i really glad of that

# available commands(for now)
### Api
|command   | output  |

|  ufact | return random useless fact :p  |
|  bored | return a suggestion of activity |
|  jokes | return a random jokes (disabled)|
|  weather < city >  |  return a report of current weather in city (disabled)|
|  numtrivia < number > | return a trivia about number but if argument remain empty or not a number trivia will be about random number

|command | output  |
|---|---|
| search < keyword > | automatically open google chrome to show result|
| wikped < keyword >  | automatically open wikipedia search to show result|
| link < url/link > | find url e.g github.com,stackoverflow.com etc and not a keyword|
  
### math
to use these command it must begin with ```math``` keyword followed by command below 
|command | output  |
|---|---|

| subs | subs of all number |
| mult | multipication of all number |

after input the command above it must followed by series of number delimited by ```,``` and ONLY ONE space between operation command and numebers

### file handling
|command | output  |
|---|---|
| cfile < filename or path to the file > < content(optional) > |create file in current path example : `cfile hello.txt this is content`. Hello is file name, and the rest will be content(one line) |
| dfile < filename or path to the file > | delete file in current path |
| cdir < folder name > | create folder in current path |
| set < dir1 > < subDir1 > < subdir of subDir1 > | change the current path, you can manipulate your file/folder in current directory,you can use space or `/` as delimiter . example : `set desktop MyFolder` or `set/desktop/MyFolder` . unfortunately you can acces sub folder of current path you set,you must re-set again(arrow up in cmd) and add your sub folder of subfolder, it may be fixed in the future :grin: |
