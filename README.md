  2. create the virtual enviroment using ```virtualenv.```
  3. type command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to install pip module.
  4. when you want to edit or add feature make sure to comment all command(voidCoommand and NonVoidCommand) in dict that used api key(when the config.MY_KEY var is present) to prevent error.<br/>

features of this app is still low and it will be great if you add some feature/command or improve this README(because i'm not good at expalain something)<br/>
